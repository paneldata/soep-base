The Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) is an extension and expansion of the Berlin Aging Study (BASE). This new study with more than 2,200 participants of different ages aims to complement the analysis of cognitive development across the lifespan by including socio-economic and biological factors such as living conditions, health, and genetic preconditions. The study is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. 
  
Participants are involved in the annual survey of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and provide information about their life situation and living conditions.

Special questions are asked in 2009 and 2012 (see below).
  
The Charité's Geriatrics Research Group at the Evangelisches Geriatriezentrum Berlin carries out the medical sessions. Data on the following domains are collected:

Objective health (e.g., cardiovascular system, musculosceletal system, immune system),

Functional capacity (e.g., physical capacity, vision, hearing, balance),

Subjective health and well-being

Genetic analyses carried out in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics can provide information about the effects of genetic differences on physical and mental development processes.

Data protection regulations are strictly followed during all assessments. The data are exclusively used for scientific purposes.
